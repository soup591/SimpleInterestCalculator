# Thanks for taking a look!

This project was created following IBM's "Full-Stack Cloud Developer" curriculum, and was the final exam for the course "Introduction to Cloud Development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript". It tested basic skills with HTML, CSS and Javascript in order to provide a fully functional Interest Calculator, that would provide alerts if incalculable values were entered into the "Amount" box. This project took me approximately three hours to complete, with various small changes made in a virtual environment before manually updated back here on Github for peer review.
